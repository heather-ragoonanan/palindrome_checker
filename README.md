WELCOME!

This is my first GitHub Repository, and I'm excited to start using this tool more to showcase my skills.

I am a career changer and I am new to the Technology industry, and whilst I do not have an academic Computer Science background, I have independently studied most of what I know.

PALINDROME CHECKER

I have created three different codes, using Python:

1) To see if a word is a palindrome or not.
2) To see how many palindromes there are, in a range of numbers.
3) To see if suggestions could be given, if a word entered isn't a palindrome.
